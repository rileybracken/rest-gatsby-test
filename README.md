## Rest API => Gatsby Source Nodes example
We need a way to figure out how to create queryable nodes in
Gatsby via a rest API. Specifically we want to be able to
query SalesForce. In this example I connect to Airtable to
show how it is possible.

The two files to look at are `gatsby-node.js` and
`src/pages/index.js`.
